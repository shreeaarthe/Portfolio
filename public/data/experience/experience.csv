Role,Company,Duration,Description
Software Engineer Trainee,IQVIA -- Bengaluru,July 2025 – Present,"Designed End-to-End RAG Pipelines using LangChain and LCEL, implementing hybrid retrieval (BM25 + FAISS) with BGE-large embeddings to maximize semantic accuracy. Optimized Retrieval Quality by integrating intelligent query routing and validated performance using the RAGAS framework, achieving a 97% context precision and recall rate. Developed Research Assistant Chatbots with complex tool-calling capabilities, integrating Arxiv, Wikipedia, and URL crawlers for dynamic information synthesis. Created an Agentic POC in C# and Go using the ReAct pattern with a modular Tool Registry, conducting comparative research on Java-based AI frameworks vs. Python LangGraph. Benchmarked Agentic flow implementations across Java, Rust, Go, C#, and JS, analyzing trade-offs in latency, concurrency, and power efficiency. "
Software Intern,Titan Company -- Hosur,July 2024 – Aug 2024,"Developed a time series sales prediction model using LSTM and Conv1D to effectively capture both long-term temporal dependencies and local sequential patterns in historical sales data. Preprocessed and structured data for deep learning, improving model efficiency and accuracy. Outperformed traditional forecasting methods, demonstrating lower MAE and RMSE across test datasets."
