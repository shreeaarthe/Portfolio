PPE Detection using YOLOv8,"Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV","Designed a computer vision pipeline using YOLOv8 and OpenCV by training two separate models for person and PPE detection. Implemented a sequential approach where detected persons were cropped and passed to the PPE model. Improved detection accuracy by 15%.",https://github.com/Thilak30/YOLOv8-Based-Multi-Stage-Person-and-PPE-Detection
Chennai Weather Forecast using Time Series,"Python, Statsmodels (SARIMAX)","Conducted time series analysis on Chennai weather forecast data by performing preprocessing EDA and applying SARIMAX and LSTM models. Achieved a forecasting accuracy improvement of 18% over baseline models enabling more reliable weather trend predictions.",https://github.com/Thilak30/Chennai-surface-temperature-Analysis
